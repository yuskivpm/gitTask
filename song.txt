Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Carry on, carry on

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

As if nothing really matters
Mama, life had just begun
Mama, ooh
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
