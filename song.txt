Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Carry on, carry on
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
