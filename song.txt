Mama, just killed a man

Put a gun against his head
Carry on, carry on
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
