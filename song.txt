Put a gun against his head
Carry on, carry on
Didn't mean to make you cry

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
